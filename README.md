This repository contains a simple showcase html page. It is a demonstration of the various ways a website can retrieve data from the sensors of a browser's host device.

The html5 features that power this is still relatively new, and currently (Nov 2013) Chrome, Firefox, and Opera are the only browsers that supports all the showcased features.
